set up the auth for the role based Access.(done)
make the changes in the frontend as assignment's backend are done !(done)

the option to add the user is still missing in the UI so need to do that!
also need a heavy improvement in the UI components as it looks so plane and the simple need to have some images and all if possible!
remove this before doing git add and all
